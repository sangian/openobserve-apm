# Dynamic Traefik Configuration
# Additional middlewares can be defined here and referenced in docker labels
# with @file (e.g., traefik.http.routers.myrouter.middlewares=rate-limit@file)

# Note: Currently no middlewares are actively used.
# Middlewares defined in docker-compose labels are applied directly.
# This file is kept for future extensibility.
